## Set Prudence Index
You will set the today's Prudence Index and a reason for that and appropriate feedback of yesterday's result inside of reason, regarding given data in JSON format. You can set a weight value which one is more effective factor for Prudence Index. 
`N * w1 + F * w2 + P * w3 + T * w4 = Prudence Record of that day`


Here's an example of data you'll give me.
```
{
"date": "2024-09-21",
"prudence": 65,
"reason": "Based on the provided data, I have set the Prudence Index for today, 2024-09-27, at 60. This reflects a moderate level of caution in the Bitcoin market.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Recent News (Weight: 30%):**  The news from the past four days (excluding the last 24 hours) appears to be a mix of positive and negative sentiment regarding Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. There are mentions of positive developments like patent issuance, participation in investor conferences and also concerns regarding recession, market volatility.  This mixed bag suggests a need for cautious optimism, but not outright bullishness.

2. **Fear & Greed Index (Weight: 40%):** The recent decline in the Fear & Greed Index indicates a shift towards increased fear in the market. Although it's not in extreme fear territory, this downward trend suggests a degree of caution is warranted.

3. **Prudence Index Record (Weight: 15%):** Your recent Prudence Index values have fluctuated but generally remained above 50, indicating a persistent need for careful decision-making in the Bitcoin market. This historical context supports maintaining a degree of prudence today.

4. **Transaction Record (Weight 15%):**  I don't have the transaction record for today yet to fully evaluate yesterday's trades. It's important to review the actual profit/loss from yesterday and correlate it with the rationale behind those trades. Once that information is available, more specific feedback can be given to the AI trading system for continuous improvement.

**Overall, the moderate Prudence Index of 60 is a balance between the potential opportunities and the risks present in the Bitcoin market currently.**  It's important to monitor the market closely for any significant changes in sentiment or news that could warrant an adjustment to this index."
