Toncoin (TON) $6 Target Extremely CloseU.Today - After decisively breaking above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, Dogecoin has shown indications of a possible trend reversal lately. In the past, the 50 EMA has served as a crucial barrier to distinguish between bullish and bearish trends. Assuming that Dogecoin is about to transition from its current downward trajectory to a new upward one, a break above it is frequently seen as a bullish signal.Having overcome its 50-day EMA, DOGE is currently trading slightly above $0.104. Given that Dogecoin has been trading in a generally bearish pattern over the last few months, this development is significant because it may signal the start of a larger reversal. If this momentum continues, Dogecoin may see additional gains in the next few days. The breakthrough above this level suggests renewed buying pressure. The potential for a golden cross adds to the intrigue of this scenario. When a long-term moving average like the 200-day EMA crosses above the short-term moving average in this example, the 50-day EMA a golden cross is formed.The current breakout gives hope that Dogecoin may eventually invalidate this bearish pattern and trigger a golden cross in place of the death cross, which occurred when the 50-day EMA crossed below the 200-day EMA. A development of that kind would probably encourage even more bullish sentiment.The 100-day and 200-day moving averages or $0.11 and $0.118 are important resistance levels to keep an eye on if Dogecoin is to keep moving higher. Indicating a return to bullish territory for DOGE, a break above these levels could confirm a reversal.After the recent rate cut of 50 basis points, which sparked a wave of capital inflows onto the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable breakout. This bullish trend has lifted Bitcoin above significant technical milestones, suggesting that the most popular cryptocurrency may make a return earlier than most people had expected. Since these moving averages frequently serve as important barriers to entry, breaking through them is a strong technical signal. When they are broken, it means that there is a positive shift in market sentiment.Since the 200-day EMA is a crucial indicator for many institutional and long-term investors, Bitcoin\\'s breakout above it is especially significant. Since there have been significant inflows onto the market, Bitcoin\\'s current price is above $62,000, and it appears that this rally may continue. If Bitcoin succeeds in surpassing the $68,000 barrier, it may indicate the start of a more extensive rebound for the whole cryptocurrency market.Past the $68,000 mark, the previous all-time highs might be the next important levels to monitor, which might pique the interest of institutional and retail investors once more. Though sentiment is generally positive, it is crucial to keep in mind that Bitcoin is still moving within a larger descending channel.If it fails to break above $68,000, this could lead to a retracement back to support levels around $60,000. However, for the time being at least, it seems that the bulls have the momentum, and Bitcoin is strengthening as it rises from its most recent lows.If TON succeeds in breaching this crucial barrier, it may surge rapidly in the direction of $6. If this is not done, though, there could be a significant retreat. The technical picture indicates that TON is at a critical juncture. The 50 EMA has historically been a strong resistance level, frequently serving as a divide between bullish and bearish trends. Because TON\\'s price is currently trading just below this level, a breakout could indicate that the asset is regaining momentum.However, if this does not happen, a retracement back to earlier support levels at $5.50 or even $5.30 may be necessary. The formation of a double-top pattern on local time frames adds to the uncertainty.If the $6 target is not hit soon, there may be an impending pullback, according to this bearish chart pattern, which frequently signals a decline in price. Before making any significant decisions, traders should be aware of this trend and wait for confirmation signals.This article was originally published on U.Today\", \"DMG Blockchain Solutions Announces Issuance of U.S Patent for Custom Mempool Protocol, Participation at Upcoming Investor ConferenceVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (\\\\\"DMG\\\\\"), a leading vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, announces the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 11,810,103 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent covers DMG\\'s innovative Custom Mempool Protocol for processing cryptographic events. This patented system allows applications to send events to hashing processors that operate on a custom mempool protocol, separate from the public blockchain protocol. Events are hashed only with other events that meet specific screening criteria, preventing transactions from being propagated to external nodes. This system enhances control over which events are processed, improving security and privacy. This patent strengthens DMG\\'s commitment to developing secure, scalable digital asset solutions that give users more control over their transactions, said DMG\\'s CEO, Sheldon Bennett. It\\'s a key element of our Core+ strategy, particularly our Petra technology. Petra is designed to offer financial institutions and sophisticated ordinal artists the ability to conduct transactions using DMG\\'s Terra Pool (NASDAQ:POOL), which operates in a carbon-neutral and regulatory-compliant environment. This patent forms the foundation of DMG\\'s previously announced Petra technology, which has been successfully applied by both financial institutions (DMG and Zodia Custody Successfully Test Blockseer\\'s Petra Platform, October 20, 2021) and ordinal creators (DMG Blockchain Solutions Reiterates Leadership in Bitcoin Blockchain Services, March 01, 2024). DMG Management at the ArcStone-Kingswood Growth Summit on September 26 in Toronto DMG\\'s management will present at the ArcStone-Kingswood Growth Summit 2024, held on September 26th from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM ET at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, 123 Queen St West, Toronto.

Terraform, which filed for bankruptcy in January, agreed to a $4.47 billion SEC settlement after a jury in Manhattan found the company liable in April for defrauding investors.The SEC will collect little, if anything, on that settlement amount because it agreed to be paid only after Terraform satisfies crypto loss claims as part of its bankruptcy wind-down. The company said it is currently \\\\\"impossible to estimate\\\\\" the total value of crypto losses that will be eligible to be paid during the liquidation.Terraform estimated that it will be able to pay between $184.5 million and $442.2 million to crypto purchasers and other stakeholders as part of its bankruptcy liquidation. The SEC had accused Terraform and founder Do Kwon of deceiving investors about the stability of TerraUSD, a stablecoin he designed to maintain a constant $1 price, and falsely claiming that Terraform\\'s blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app. A jury found Kwon and Terraform Labs liable on civil fraud charges at trial, and Kwon and Terraform decided to settle with the SEC before a second phase of the trial that would have determined the amount of damages.Kwon faces related criminal charges both in the United States and his native South Korea. He has denied wrongdoing.TerraUSD and the closely linked Luna, a more traditional token that Kwon also designed, collapsed in May 2022 when TerraUSD was unable to maintain its peg to the dollar. The collapse of the two cryptocurrencies caused a market crash that triggered a wave of bankruptcies in the crypto industry. \", \"Nasdaq Stock Hits All-Time High at $74.18 Amid Market OptimismIn a remarkable display of market resilience, Nasdaq Omx Group Inc.

Rates had previously been at a more than two-decade high for over a year.Speaking to reporters at a Bitcoin bar in New York City following the decision, Trump said the reduction, which was the Fed\\'s first since 2020, shows that \\\\\"the economy would be very bad, or they\\'re playing politics, one or the other.\\\\\" He added it was a \\\\\"big cut.\\\\\"At a closely-watched press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell downplayed concerns about a recession, pointing to resilient economic growth, cooling price gains and a \\\\\"solid\\\\\" labor market.\\\\\"The US economy is in a good place and our decision today is designed to keep it there,\\\\\" Powell said.He also stressed that the Fed was only carrying out a \\\\\"recalibration\\\\\" of its rate policy and is not instituting a \\\\\"new pace\\\\\" of cuts. He added that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was not in a \\\\\"rush\\\\\" to slash borrowing costs.Along with the drawdown, an updated \\\\\"dot plot\\\\\" of officials\\' policy forecasts indicated that policymakers now expect the benchmark fed funds rate to dip to 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024. This would suggest either another jumbo half-point rate cut or two smaller quarter-point cuts at the Fed\\'s two remaining gatherings this year.Powell, who was nominated to his current position by Trump in 2017 and is a registered Republican, also responded to claims that the 50-basis point cut was politically motivated. He said the FOMC only concerns itself with doing \\\\\"the right thing [...] for the people we serve.\\\\\"\\\\\"[W]e do that, and we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it. And that\\\\u2019s always what it is. It\\\\u2019s never about anything else. Nothing else is discussed,\\\\\" Powell said.Powell was a target of criticism during Trump\\'s previous term in the White House, particularly after the then-President called on the Fed to cut rates during a time of rising global trade tensions. In one instance, Trump lashed out at Powell, questioning whether he was a \\\\\"bigger enemy\\\\\" to the US than Chinese President Xi Jinping.Brad Case, Chief Economist at Middleburg Communities, suggested that other Republicans would rally to support Trump\\'s claim, and potentially encourage some GOP members in Congress to purpose legislation reducing the Fed\\'s independence.For its part, the Fed has said that it was created as an independent and non-partisan central bank -- a position that Powell reiterated again on Wednesday.\\\\\"Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people. And if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly. So this really concentrates the mind,\\\\\" Powell said. \\\\\"And, you know, it\\\\u2019s something we all take very, very seriously. We don\\\\u2019t put up any other filters. I think if you start doing that, I don\\\\u2019t know where you stop.\\\\\"Elsewhere, Kamala Harris, Trump\\'s Democratic rival in November\\'s all-important presidential election, called the rate cuts \\\\\"welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices.\\\\\"Recent polls have pointed to inflation, which has moderated in the US after a post-pandemic surge, as one of the major financial concerns for voters prior to the vote.\", \"Gryphon Digital Mining names new CEO and ChairmanLAS VEGAS - Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc.

(Nasdaq | TSX: NASDAQ:HUT) (Hut 8 or the Company), a leading, vertically integrated operator of large-scale energy infrastructure and one of North America\\'s largest Bitcoin miners, today announced the expansion of its partnership with BI\\\\u2122AIN Technologies Ltd. (BI\\\\u2122AIN), the world\\'s largest manufacturer of digital currency mining servers, with the launch of the U3S21EXPH, a next-generation ASIC miner. Hut 8 plans to deploy the model in Q2 2025 through a ~15 exahash per second (EH/s) hosting agreement leveraging custom data center infrastructure developed in-house by Hut 8. As part of its long-term, power-first strategy, Hut 8 continues to scale its compute layer across energy-intensive technologies, including both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, with the aim of maximizing returns on its portfolio of power assets and digital infrastructure. The launch and commercialization of the U3S21EXPH is a key milestone in executing this strategy in the Company\\'s Bitcoin mining segment as it advances scaled opportunities in AI compute. Revolutionizing ASIC Compute: U3S21EXPH The U3S21EXPH will be the first ASIC miner mass-commercialized by BI\\\\u2122AIN to feature direct liquid-to-chip (DLC) cooling within a U form factor. Capable of achieving up to 860 terahash at an efficiency of 13 joules per terahash, the model represents the culmination of an extensive miner-manufacturer partnership between Hut 8 and BI\\\\u2122AIN. Under the partnership, which spans technical and commercial innovation, Hut 8 supported BI\\\\u2122AIN in the development of the miner. Key advancements: Technology: Introduces DLC cooling technology used in high-performance computing (HPC) data centers to a rack-ready form factor for Bitcoin miningEngineering: Evolution from shoebox ASIC form factor incompatible with traditional data center rack architecture to U form factor compatible with HPC-style architecture that can be deployed at densities of up to ~180 kilowatts (kW) per rackProcurement: Strong overlap in secondary components with HPC data centers, including racks and cooling systems required for DLC technology, driving the opportunity for greater supply chain synchronization across Bitcoin mining and HPC data centersConstruction: Opportunity to apply construction expertise and capabilities across Bitcoin mining and HPC data centers To fully harness the potential of the U3S21EXPH, Hut 8 has developed a custom design for Bitcoin mining data center infrastructure inspired by traditional rack-based architecture. This design will be leveraged to house the initial ~15 EH/s deployment at a density of up to ~180 kW per rack. Our partnership with BI\\\\u2122AIN has allowed us to advance our thinking on ASIC compute and create a more scalable model for data center design as we expand our footprint,\\\\\" said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. The U3S21EXPH will be the first miner from BI\\\\u2122AIN broadly commercialized with DLC cooling within a U form factor, making it rack-ready like traditional data center hardware. This innovation bridges critical engineering gaps between Bitcoin mining and AI data center infrastructure in both form factor and cooling technology, and we believe this convergence will enable us to unlock significant synergies and flexibility going forward. Asher and Mike have been invaluable thought partners to BI\\\\u2122AIN since the early days of US Bitcoin Corp, where they demonstrated a unique focus on cost-efficient procurement and operations, said Irene Gao, Vice President of Mining of BI\\\\u2122AIN. Hut 8\\'s technical expertise, operating strength, and track record of innovation made this partnership a natural evolution of our relationship as we began the journey of developing next-generation ASIC technology. We are excited to deepen our relationship as we continue to define the future of mining. Commercializing the U3S21EXPH The U3S21EXPH will be commercialized through a creatively structured hosting agreement between Hut 8 and BI\\\\u2122AIN. The agreement features a favorable fixed hosting fee with an option for Hut 8 to purchase all or a portion of the hosted machines in up to three tranches at a fixed price within six months of energization of the relevant tranches. The structure is designed to drive a superior risk-return profile for the acquisition of new machines for Hut 8\\'s self-mining fleet by reducing upfront capital requirements, offering a lower cost of capital, and de-risking a potential purchase by allowing the Company to assess future market conditions before committing additional capital. The initial agreement comprises ~15 EH/s and is expected to increase Hut 8\\'s hashrate under management from 18.5 EH/s1 to ~33.5 EH/s. If Hut 8 were to execute the purchase option for the entirety of the ~15 EH/s hosting deployment, the Company\\'s self-mining hashrate is expected to increase from 5.6 EH/s1,2 to ~20.6 EH/s. Our team worked closely with BI\\\\u2122AIN to implement an innovative structure to commercialize the U3S21EXPH before it became available to the broader market, said Genoot. For Hut 8, the benefit of the structure is twofold: it protects our downside with a fixed-price hosting revenue stream, and it creates significant option value with a fixed-price purchase option. We believe this model represents a more thoughtful approach to capturing the lucrative economics offered by next-generation machines, reducing upfront capital requirements while we continue to pursue growth initiatives in AI infrastructure. Notes: Based on the Company\\'s capacity as of August 31, 2024.Includes 100% of deployed hashrate at the King Mountain site, which is owned by the King Mountain JV in which the Company has a 50% membership interested and a Fortune 200 renewable energy producer has the remaining 50% membership interest.

Media Relationsmedia@hut8.com Source: Hut 8 Corp.U3S21EXPH to be first ASIC miner mass-commercialized by BI\\\\u2122AIN with direct liquid-to-chip cooling within U form factorHut 8 plans to deploy model in Q2 2025 through ~15 EH/s hosting deployment with potential transition to self-mining through purchase option MIAMI, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hut 8 Corp. (Nasdaq | TSX: NASDAQ:HUT) (Hut 8 or the Company), a leading, vertically integrated operator of large-scale energy infrastructure and one of North America\\'s largest Bitcoin miners, today announced the expansion of its partnership with BI\\\\u2122AIN Technologies Ltd. (BI\\\\u2122AIN), the world\\'s largest manufacturer of digital currency mining servers, with the launch of the U3S21EXPH, a next-generation ASIC miner. Hut 8 plans to deploy the model in Q2 2025 through a ~15 exahash per second (EH/s) hosting agreement leveraging custom data center infrastructure developed in-house by Hut 8.As part of its long-term, power-first strategy, Hut 8 continues to scale its compute layer across energy-intensive technologies, including both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, with the aim of maximizing returns on its portfolio of power assets and digital infrastructure. The launch and commercialization of the U3S21EXPH is a key milestone in executing this strategy in the Company\\'s Bitcoin mining segment as it advances scaled opportunities in AI compute.Revolutionizing ASIC Compute: U3S21EXPHThe U3S21EXPH will be the first ASIC miner mass-commercialized by BI\\\\u2122AIN to feature direct liquid-to-chip (DLC) cooling within a U form factor. Capable of achieving up to 860 terahash at an efficiency of 13 joules per terahash, the model represents the culmination of an extensive miner-manufacturer partnership between Hut 8 and BI\\\\u2122AIN. Under the partnership, which spans technical and commercial innovation, Hut 8 supported BI\\\\u2122AIN in the development of the miner.Key advancements:To fully harness the potential of the U3S21EXPH, Hut 8 has developed a custom design for Bitcoin mining data center infrastructure inspired by traditional rack-based architecture. This design will be leveraged to house the initial ~15 EH/s deployment at a density of up to ~180 kW per rack.Our partnership with BI\\\\u2122AIN has allowed us to advance our thinking on ASIC compute and create a more scalable model for data center design as we expand our footprint,\\\\\" said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. The U3S21EXPH will be the first miner from BI\\\\u2122AIN broadly commercialized with DLC cooling within a U form factor, making it rack-ready like traditional data center hardware. This innovation bridges critical engineering gaps between Bitcoin mining and AI data center infrastructure in both form factor and cooling technology, and we believe this convergence will enable us to unlock significant synergies and flexibility going forward.Asher and Mike have been invaluable thought partners to BI\\\\u2122AIN since the early days of US Bitcoin Corp, where they demonstrated a unique focus on cost-efficient procurement and operations, said Irene Gao, Vice President of Mining of BI\\\\u2122AIN. Hut 8\\'s technical expertise, operating strength, and track record of innovation made this partnership a natural evolution of our relationship as we began the journey of developing next-generation ASIC technology. We are excited to deepen our relationship as we continue to define the future of mining.Commercializing the U3S21EXPHThe U3S21EXPH will be commercialized through a creatively structured hosting agreement between Hut 8 and BI\\\\u2122AIN. The agreement features a favorable fixed hosting fee with an option for Hut 8 to purchase all or a portion of the hosted machines in up to three tranches at a fixed price within six months of energization of the relevant tranches.The structure is designed to drive a superior risk-return profile for the acquisition of new machines for Hut 8\\'s self-mining fleet by reducing upfront capital requirements, offering a lower cost of capital, and de-risking a potential purchase by allowing the Company to assess future market conditions before committing additional capital.The initial agreement comprises ~15 EH/s and is expected to increase Hut 8\\'s hashrate under management from 18.5 EH/s1 to ~33.5 EH/s. If Hut 8 were to execute the purchase option for the entirety of the ~15 EH/s hosting deployment, the Company\\'s self-mining hashrate is expected to increase from 5.6 EH/s1,2 to ~20.6 EH/s.Our team worked closely with BI\\\\u2122AIN to implement an innovative structure to commercialize the U3S21EXPH before it became available to the broader market, said Genoot. For Hut 8, the benefit of the structure is twofold: it protects our downside with a fixed-price hosting revenue stream, and it creates significant option value with a fixed-price purchase option. We believe this model represents a more thoughtful approach to capturing the lucrative economics offered by next-generation machines, reducing upfront capital requirements while we continue to pursue growth initiatives in AI infrastructure.Notes:About Hut 8 \\\\u00a0Hut 8 Corp. is an energy infrastructure operator and Bitcoin miner with self-mining, hosting, managed services, and traditional data center operations across North America.

On September 12, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a resolution allowing employees, officers, and directors to receive up to three months of their cash compensation in advance as restricted common stock.This strategic move is designed to mitigate potential operational disruptions due to the need to unstake and sell cryptocurrency for cash requirements. The decision follows delays by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in reviewing the company\\'s responses to a comment letter, which has affected BTCS Inc.\\'s ability to raise capital and potentially jeopardized the interests of about 30,000 retail investors.As a result of the board\\'s approval, on the following day, September 13, 2024, all company employees, directors, and officers\\\\u2014totaling nine individuals\\\\u2014elected to accept part of their compensation in equity, leading to the issuance of 347,970 restricted common stock shares. These shares were issued at a 20% discount to the closing stock price of the company, resulting in a $330,000 reduction in cash compensation. The shares are subject to a six-month holding period under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.This information is based on a press release statement and has been reported in compliance with SEC filing requirements. It is important to note that the shares issued are not registered and that the equity compensation plan is exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 506 of Regulation D.In other recent news, BTCS Inc. has reported significant developments. The company\\'s shareholders recently approved key proposals at its annual meeting, including the election of five directors to the board and the ratification of RBSM LLP as the independent auditor.

His chart provides a unique perspective on the current state of the market by highlighting price trends and Bitcoin\\'s inventory on exchanges. It emphasizes cautious optimism amid ongoing market movements. Woo anticipates that Bitcoin\\'s current bullish swing will continue in the near future, probably for an additional week. Bitcoin is displaying a bull flag on the chart, a typical technical pattern that denotes a sustained upward movement following a brief period of consolidation.This is a promising signal for traders seeking quick profits over the coming days. Woo notes that when taking derivatives into account, exchange inventory stays flat, and there is a notable accumulation of spot Bitcoin in the medium term. This implies that although there has not been much movement in derivatives trading, there is consistent buying going on in the spot market, especially by investors and long-term holders. The accumulation of Bitcoin may portend an impending bull market move, particularly if the demand continues. But Woo is still being cautious. The market is not under pressure to sell off right now, but it has not completely transitioned to a bullish structure either. The demand and supply dynamics at this point are neutral to bearish. Woo points out that a possible short squeeze might swiftly alter the situation and cause liquidations, which would raise the price of Bitcoin. Should that occur, there is a chance that the market will firmly enter a bullish phase. As usual, Woo\\'s analysis provides traders and investors with insightful information.This article was originally published on U.Today\"]}'"
